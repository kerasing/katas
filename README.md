# Why katas
As I have moved from a software development role into a role where I don't program, and I don't want to lose my programming chops. As a result, I've decided to start doing some katas, to keep in practice. 

# Where did I find these
- Putting the DnD in TDD was a presentation by Guy Royse and George Walters at PrairieCode 2016
- [codingdojo](http://codingdojo.org/kata/) is a resource one of my teams use for katas
